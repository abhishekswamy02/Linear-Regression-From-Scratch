##  Project Overview

This project predicts house prices using manually implemented Linear Regression. Instead of relying on prebuilt ML libraries, the algorithm is built step-by-step to demonstrate how predictions, loss calculation, and optimization work internally.

## Project Structure

- Dataset loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature scaling
- Manual implementation of Linear Regression
- Loss calculation (MSE)
- Gradient Descent optimization
- Model evaluation (RMSE, R²)

- 
## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this project, learners will be able to:

- Understand Linear Regression mathematically
- Preprocess real-world datasets
- Implement Mean Squared Error loss
- Apply Gradient Descent optimization
- Evaluate regression models using RMSE and R²
- 
- ## ▶ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
 git clone https://github.com/abhishekswamy02/Linear-Regression-From-Scratch.git
